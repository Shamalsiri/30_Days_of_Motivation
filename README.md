# 30 Days of Motivation
\- by Shamal Siriwardana

## About the project

[30 Days of Motivation](https://github.com/Shamalsiri/30_Days_of_Motivation/tree/master) is a project assigned under the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) course provided by [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com). 

As part of [Unit 3: Display List and Use Material Design](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/unit-3), the developer is tasked with creating an application that displays content on a theme of their choice, showing one piece of content or tip for each day of the month.

## Approach

For this application, the following considerations were made:

1. Create a calendar view that reflects the actual calendar and updates as months and years change.
2. Highlight today's date.
3. Make each date clickable, while empty cells and day definitions (e.g., Sunday, Monday, etc.) are not clickable.
4. When a date is clicked, a Motivation card will open/pop up.
5. The Motivation card will contain:
    - Day
    - Date
    - Close Button
    - Motivational Image
    - Motivational Quote
    - Motivational Quote Author
